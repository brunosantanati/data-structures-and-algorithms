## THE ULTIMATE DSA GUIDE
### Data Structure specific algorithms
### 1. Arrays
- Sorting:

  - QuickSort: Efficient average-case time complexity (O(nlog n))

  - MergeSort: Stable sort, useful when order matters (O(nlog n))

- Searching:

  - Binary Search: Fast search in sorted arrays (O(log n))

- Two Pointers:

  - In-place manipulation, often for sorted arrays (e.g., removing duplicates)

- Sliding Window:

  - Subarray problems, finding maximum/minimum within a window
 
### 2. Linked Lists
- Traversal:

  - Iterate through the list, understand the node structure

- Insertion/Deletion:

  - At beginning, end, or at a specific position

- Reversal:

  - In-place reversal, recursive and iterative approaches

- Cycle Detection:

  - Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm

### 3. Hash Tables (Hash Maps/Sets)
- Implementation not needed. Just understand following:

  - Understand how hash functions work

  - Insertion/Deletion/Lookup

  - Collision Handling

### 4. Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
- Traversal:

  - Inorder, Preorder, Postorder (recursive and iterative)

- Searching:

  - Find a node with a given value (especially in BSTs)

### 5. Stacks
- Implementation not needed. Just understand following:

  - Push/Pop/Peek Operations

### 6. Queues
- Implementation not needed. Just understand following:

  - Enqueue/Dequeue Operations

### 7. Heaps (Priority Queues)
- Implementation not needed. Just understand following:

  - Insertion/Deletion (extract-min/max)

  - Building a Heap

- Top K Elements:

  - Using a heap to find k largest/smallest elements

### 8. Graphs
- Traversal:

  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)

  - Depth-First Search (DFS)

- Shortest Path:

  - Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Cycle Detection:

  - DFS

### 9. Tries
- Implement Trie from scratch

- Insertion/Searching:

  - For words/prefixes

- Autocompletion:

  - Using a trie for word suggestions

### 10. Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
- Implement Union-Find from scratch

- Find/Union Operations

- Cycle Detection in undirected graphs

### General algorithms/techniques
### 1. Recursion
- Defining a problem in terms of itself, often leading to elegant and concise solutions.

- Solve: Factorial calculation, tree traversals, depth-first search.

### 2. Dynamic Programming
- Breaking down a problem into overlapping subproblems and storing solutions to avoid recomputation.

- Solve: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence.

### 3. Greedy Algorithms
- Making locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.

- Implement: Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.

### 4. Backtracking
- Incrementally building solutions, exploring all possible paths, and abandoning invalid ones.

Solve: Sudoku solver, N-Queens problem, generating permutations.
